<p>
Current language models use nowadays an
impressive amount of parameters, training data and computing
ressources. Their properties are not well understood and they do not
rely on a strong theoretical basis with respect to linguistics or
cognitive sciences. The COMPO project aims to explictly introduce
<strong>compositionality</strong> and <strong>memory limitation</strong> related biases in
language models with the goal in the long term to propose models that are less data and resource intensive.
